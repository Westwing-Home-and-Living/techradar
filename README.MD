# Westwing tech radar 

At [Westwing](http://westwing.de), we maintain a [public Tech
Radar](https://westwing-home-and-living.github.io/techradar/) to help our engineering teams
align on technology choices. It is based on the [pioneering work
by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

This repository contains the code to generate the visualization:
[`radar.js`](/docs/radar.js) (based on [d3.js v4](https://d3js.org)).
Feel free to use and adapt it for your own purposes.
